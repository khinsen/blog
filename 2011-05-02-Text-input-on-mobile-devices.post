<p>I have been using mobile (pocket size) computers for about 15 years, starting with the Palm Pilot. Currently I use an Android smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S). While mobile devices are mostly used for consulting rather than for entering information, text entry has always been a hot topic of debate.</p><br><p>Apple's Newton Messagepad, probably the first mobile computing device in the modern sense, pursued the ambitious goal of handwriting recognition. It was both an impressive technical achievement and a practical failure. I don't think anyone ever managed to use the Newton's handwriting recognition satisfactorily in daily life.</p><br><p>The Palm Pilot had a more modest but also more achievable goal: its Graffiti technology was based on single letter recognition with simplified letter shapes. It took a while to become fluent with Graffiti, but many people managed and I don't remember anyone complainig about. the nearning curve.</p><br><p>I don't remember when I first saw a miniature QWERTY keyboard on the screen of a mobile device, but it may well have been on one of the first iPhones. I was definitely not enthusiastic about it. The keys are much too small for touch-typing, and the layout was already a bad choice for desktop computer keyboards. The only argument in its favor is familiarity, but is that a good enough reason to cripple oneself for a long time to come?</p><br><p>When I got my Android phone, I was rapidly confronted with this issue in practice. Samsung left me the choice between the standard keyboard and Swype. Both had the same problem: too small keys for my fingers. I turned to the Android market and found many more QWERTY keyboards. And... Graffiti, my old friend from my Palm days. What a relief!</p><br><p>Of course, my phone is not a Palm. The Biggest difference is that the Palm had a stylus whereas today's smartphones are meant to be manipulated withthe fingers. But Graffiti works surprisingly well without a stylus. I find that I can write about equally well w√Øth the index or the thumb. Graffiti definitely is a good choice for Android, especially for Palm veterans.</p><br><p>Recently I discovered another alternative input and I like it enough that I might end up preferring it over Graffiti. It's called MessagEase and it consists of a 3x3 grid of comfortably large keys that display the 9 most frequent characters. The remaining characters, plus punctuation etc., is available by drawing lines outward from the center of a key. The technique doesn't require much time to master,  but writing fluently requires a lot of practice because the layout needs to be memorized.</p><br><p>I started using MessagEase about two weeks ago and have reached about the same speed I ge	 with Graffiti. I wrote this whole article with MessagEase as a real-life exercise. Time will tell if I actually get faster than with Graffiti, but MessagEase definitely is a serious candidate for mobile texting in the post-QWERTY era. If you have an Android phone or an iPhone, give it a try.</p>
