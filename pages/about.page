This blog is mostly about topics related to my work as a researcher in computational biophysics. However, all the views expressed here are my own and not my employer's.

There are a few other places where you can find me or my work:

- Check out my [home page](http://khinsen.net/)
- Contact me [on Mastodon](https://scholar.social/@khinsen) or [on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/khinsen.net) (I am much more active on Mastodon)
- See also my digital garden on [Science in the Digital Era](https://science-in-the-digital-era.khinsen.net/)
